The textbook for the Data Science course series is [freely available online](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/){target="_blank"}.

This course corresponds to the Probability section of textbook, starting [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html){target="_blank"}.

This course assumes you are comfortable with basic math, algebra, and logical operations. HarvardX has partnered with DataCamp for all assignments in R that allow you to program directly in a browser-based interface. You will not need to download any special software.

Using a combination of a guided introduction through short video lectures and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice your new R skills on real-life applications.

Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn important concepts in probability theory. The motivation for this course is the circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of certain securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability. We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing are likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance. Statistical inference, covered in the next course in this series, builds upon probability theory.

# Learning Objectives

* Important concepts in probability theory including random variables and independence
* How to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
* The meaning of expected values and standard errors and how to compute them in R
* The importance of the Central Limit Theorem

## Course Overview

### Section 1: Discrete Probability
You will learn about basic principles of probability related to categorical data using card games as examples.

### Section 2: Continuous Probability
You will learn about basic principles of probability related to numeric and continuous data.

### Section 3: Random Variables, Sampling Models, and The Central Limit Theorem
You will learn about random variables (numeric outcomes resulting from random processes), how to model data generation procedures as draws from an urn, and the Central Limit Theorem, which applies to large sample sizes.

### Section 4: The Big Short
You will learn how interest rates are determined and how some bad assumptions led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

# Section 1 Overview

Section 1 introduces you to Discrete Probability. Section 1 is divided into three parts:
  
  * Introduction to Discrete Probability
* Combinations and Permutations
* Addition Rule and Monty Hall

After completing Section 1, you will be able to:
  
  * Apply basic probability theory to categorical data.
* Perform a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the results of repeating an experiment over and over, including simulating the outcomes in the Monty Hall problem.
* Distinguish between: sampling with and without replacement, events that are and are not independent, and combinations and permutations.
* Apply the multiplication and addition rules, as appropriate, to calculate the probably of multiple events occurring.
* Use **sapply** instead of a for loop to perform element-wise operations on a function.

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#discrete-probability){target="_blank"}.
                                                  
                                                  **Key points**
                                                    
                                                    * The *probability of an event* is the proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment independently under the same conditions.
                                                  
                                                  $\mbox{Pr}(A)$ = probability of event A
                                                  
                                                  * An *event* is defined as an outcome that can occur when when something happens by chance.
                                                  * We can determine probabilities related to discrete variables (picking a red bead, choosing 48 Democrats and 52 Republicans from 100 likely voters) and continuous variables (height over 6 feet).

                                                  The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#monte-carlo-simulations){target="_blank"}.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    **Key points**
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      * Monte Carlo simulations model the probability of different outcomes by repeating a random process a large enough number of times that the results are similar to what would be observed if the process were repeated forever.
                                                                                                    * The **sample** function draws random outcomes from a set of options.
                                                                                                    * The **replicate** function repeats lines of code a set number of times. It is used with **sample** and similar functions to run Monte Carlo simulations.

                                                                                                    Before we continue, we will briefly explain the following important line of code:
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
                                                                                                    set.seed(1986)
                                                                                                    ```
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    Throughout this book, we use random number generators. This implies that many of the results presented can actually change by chance, which then suggests that a frozen version of the book may show a different result than what you obtain when you try to code as shown in the book. This is actually fine since the results are random and change from time to time. However, if you want to to ensure that results are exactly the same every time you run them, you can set R’s random number generation seed to a specific number. Above we set it to 1986. We want to avoid using the same seed every time. A popular way to pick the seed is the year - month - day. For example, we picked 1986 on December 20, 2018:  2018 − 12 − 20 = 1986.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    You can learn more about setting the seed by looking at the documentation:

                                                                                                    In the exercises, we may ask you to set the seed to assure that the results you obtain are exactly what we expect them to be.

                                                                                                      R was updated to version 3.6 in early 2019. In this update, the default method for setting the seed changed. This means that exercises, videos, textbook excerpts and other code you encounter online may yield a different result based on your version of R.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    If you are running R 3.6, you can revert to the original seed setting behavior by adding the argument sample.kind="Rounding". For example:

It is very common to use the ```mean``` function in this way to calculate probabilities and we will do so throughout the course.

First, R evaluates the logical statement ```beads == "blue"```, which generates the vector:
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      ```FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE```
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    When the ```mean``` function is applied, R coerces the logical values to numeric values, changing TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0:
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      ```0 0 1 1 1```
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    The mean of the zeros and ones thus gives the proportion of TRUE values. As we have learned and will continue to see, probabilities are directly related to the proportion of events that satisfy a requirement.

He doesn't think his current special actually allows that number of choices, but wants to change his special if needed to allow at least 365 choices.

A meal at the restaurant includes 1 entree, 2 sides, and 1 drink. He currently offers a choice of 1 entree from a list of 6 options, a choice of 2 different sides from a list of 6 options, and a choice of 1 drink from a list of 2 options.

2a. How many meal combinations are possible with the current menu?

```{r}
6 * nrow(combinations(6,2)) * 2
```

2b. The manager has one additional drink he could add to the special.

How many combinations are possible if he expands his original special to 3 drink options?

```{r}
6 * nrow(combinations(6,2)) * 3
```

2c. The manager decides to add the third drink but needs to expand the number of options. The manager would prefer not to change his menu further and wants to know if he can meet his goal by letting customers choose more sides.

How many meal combinations are there if customers can choose from 6 entrees, 3 drinks, and select 3 sides from the current 6 options?

```{r}
6 * nrow(combinations(6,3)) * 3
```

2d. The manager is concerned that customers may not want 3 sides with their meal. He is willing to increase the number of entree choices instead, but if he adds too many expensive options it could eat into profits. He wants to know how many entree choices he would have to offer in order to meet his goal.

* Write a function that takes a number of entree choices and returns the number of meal combinations possible given that number of entree options, 3 drink choices, and a selection of 2 sides from 6 options.
* Use ```sapply``` to apply the function to entree option counts ranging from 1 to 12.

What is the minimum number of entree options required in order to generate more than 365 combinations?

```{r}
entree_choices <- function(x){
  x * nrow(combinations(6,2)) * 3
}

combos <- sapply(1:12, entree_choices)

data.frame(entrees = 1:12, combos = combos) %>%
  filter(combos > 365) %>%
  min(.$entrees)
```

2e. The manager isn't sure he can afford to put that many entree choices on the lunch menu and thinks it would be cheaper for him to expand the number of sides. He wants to know how many sides he would have to offer to meet his goal of at least 365 combinations.

* Write a function that takes a number of side choices and returns the number of meal combinations possible given 6 entree choices, 3 drink choices, and a selection of 2 sides from the specified number of side choices.
* Use ```sapply``` to apply the function to side counts ranging from 2 to 12.

What is the minimum number of side options required in order to generate more than 365 combinations?
  
  ```{r}
side_choices <- function(x){
  6 * nrow(combinations(x, 2)) * 3
}

combos <- sapply(2:12, side_choices)

data.frame(sides = 2:12, combos = combos) %>%
  filter(combos > 365) %>%
  min(.$sides)
```

## Assessment - Esophageal cancer and alcohol/tobacco use

3., 4., 5. and 6. Case-control studies help determine whether certain exposures are associated with outcomes such as developing cancer. The built-in dataset **esoph** contains data from a case-control study in France comparing people with esophageal cancer (cases, counted in **ncases**) to people without esophageal cancer (controls, counted in **ncontrols**) that are carefully matched on a variety of demographic and medical characteristics. The study compares alcohol intake in grams per day (**alcgp**) and tobacco intake in grams per day (**tobgp**) across cases and controls grouped by age range (**agegp**).

The dataset is available in base R and can be called with the variable name **esoph**:
  
  ```{r}
head(esoph)
```

You will be using this dataset to answer the following four multi-part questions (Questions 3-6).

You may wish to use the tidyverse package.

The following three parts have you explore some basic characteristics of the dataset.

Each row contains one group of the experiment. Each group has a different combination of age, alcohol consumption, and tobacco consumption. The number of cancer cases and number of controls (individuals without cancer) are reported for each group.

3a. How many groups are in the study?
  
  ```{r}
nrow(esoph)
```

3b. How many cases are there?
  
  Save this value as ```all_cases``` for later problems.

```{r}
all_cases <- sum(esoph$ncases)
all_cases
```

3c. How many controls are there?
  
  Save this value as ```all_controls``` for later problems. Remember from the instructions that controls are individuals without cancer.

```{r}
all_controls <- sum(esoph$ncontrols)
all_controls
```

4a. What is the probability that a subject in the highest alcohol consumption group is a cancer case?
  
  Remember that the total number of individuals in the study includes people with cancer (cases) and people without cancer (controls), so you must add both values together to get the denominator for your probability.

```{r}
esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "120+") %>%
  summarize(ncases = sum(ncases), ncontrols = sum(ncontrols)) %>%
  mutate(p_case = ncases / (ncases + ncontrols)) %>%
  pull(p_case)
```

4b. What is the probability that a subject in the lowest alcohol consumption group is a cancer case?
  
  ```{r}
esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "0-39g/day") %>%
  summarize(ncases = sum(ncases), ncontrols = sum(ncontrols)) %>%
  mutate(p_case = ncases / (ncases + ncontrols)) %>%
  pull(p_case)
```

4c. Given that a person is a case, what is the probability that they smoke 10g or more a day?
  
  ```{r}
tob_cases <- esoph %>%
  filter(tobgp != "0-9g/day") %>%
  pull(ncases) %>%
  sum()

tob_cases/all_cases
```

4d. Given that a person is a control, what is the probability that they smoke 10g or more a day?
  
  ```{r}
tob_controls <- esoph %>%
  filter(tobgp != "0-9g/day") %>%
  pull(ncontrols) %>%
  sum()

tob_controls/all_controls
```

5a. For cases, what is the probability of being in the highest alcohol group?
  
  ```{r}
high_alc_cases <- esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "120+") %>%
  pull(ncases) %>%
  sum()

p_case_high_alc <- high_alc_cases/all_cases
p_case_high_alc
```

5b. For cases, what is the probability of being in the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
high_tob_cases <- esoph %>%
  filter(tobgp == "30+") %>%
  pull(ncases) %>%
  sum()

p_case_high_tob <- high_tob_cases/all_cases
p_case_high_tob
```

5c. For cases, what is the probability of being in the highest alcohol group **and** the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
high_alc_tob_cases <- esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "120+" & tobgp == "30+") %>%
  pull(ncases) %>%
  sum()

p_case_high_alc_tob <- high_alc_tob_cases/all_cases
p_case_high_alc_tob
```

5d. For cases, what is the probability of being in the highest alcohol group **or** the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
p_case_either_highest <- p_case_high_alc + p_case_high_tob - p_case_high_alc_tob
p_case_either_highest
```

6a. For controls, what is the probability of being in the highest alcohol group?
  
  ```{r}
high_alc_controls <- esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "120+") %>%
  pull(ncontrols) %>%
  sum()

p_control_high_alc <- high_alc_controls/all_controls
round(p_control_high_alc, 4)
```

6b. How many times more likely are cases than controls to be in the highest alcohol group?
  
  ```{r}
p_case_high_alc/p_control_high_alc
```

6c. For controls, what is the probability of being in the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
high_tob_controls <- esoph %>%
  filter(tobgp == "30+") %>%
  pull(ncontrols) %>%
  sum()

p_control_high_tob <- high_tob_controls/all_controls
p_control_high_tob
```

6d. For controls, what is the probability of being in the highest alcohol group **and** the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
high_alc_tob_controls <- esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "120+" & tobgp == "30+") %>%
  pull(ncontrols) %>%
  sum()

p_control_high_alc_tob <- high_alc_tob_controls/all_controls
p_control_high_alc_tob
```

6e. For controls, what is the probability of being in the highest alcohol group **or** the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
p_control_either_highest <- p_control_high_alc + p_control_high_tob - p_control_high_alc_tob
p_control_either_highest
```

6f. How many times more likely are cases than controls to be in the highest alcohol group or the highest tobacco group?
  
  ```{r}
p_case_either_highest/p_control_either_highest
```

# Section 2 Overview

Section 2 introduces you to Continuous Probability.

After completing Section 2, you will:
  
  * understand the differences between calculating probabilities for discrete and continuous data.
* be able to use cumulative distribution functions to assign probabilities to intervals when dealing with continuous data.
* be able to use R to generate normally distributed outcomes for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
* know some of the useful theoretical continuous distributions in addition to the normal distribution, such as the student-t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta, and beta-binomial distributions.

## Continuous Probability

                                                                                                                                                                    * The *cumulative distribution function (CDF)* is a distribution function for continuous data $x$ that reports the proportion of the data below $a$ for all values of $a$:
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                    $F(a) = \mbox{Pr}(a) = \mbox{Pr}(x \le a)$

(Real ACT scores are integers between 1 and 36, but we will ignore this detail and use continuous values instead.)

Set the seed to 16, then use **rnorm** to generate a normal distribution of 10000 tests with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. Save these values as **act_scores**. You'll be using this dataset throughout these four multi-part questions.

Recall from [Data Visualization](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-visualization){target="_blank"} (the second course in this series) that to standardize values (convert values into Z-scores, that is, values distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), you must subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation. Use the mean and standard deviation of **act_scores**, not the original values used to generate random test scores.

```{r}
# sampling model 1: define urn, then sample
color <- rep(c("Black", "Red", "Green"), c(18, 18, 2)) # define the urn for the sampling model
n <- 1000
X <- sample(ifelse(color == "Red", -1, 1), n, replace = TRUE)    # 1000 draws from urn, -1 if red, else +1
X[1:10]    # first 10 outcomes

# sampling model 2: define urn inside sample function by noting probabilities
x <- sample(c(-1, 1), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(9/19, 10/19))    # 1000 independent draws
S <- sum(x)    # total winnings = sum of draws
S
```

We use the sampling model to run a Monte Carlo simulation and use the results to estimate the probability of the casino losing money.

```{r}
n <- 1000    # number of roulette players
B <- 10000    # number of Monte Carlo experiments
S <- replicate(B, {
    X <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(9/19, 10/19))    # simulate 1000 roulette spins
    sum(X)    # determine total profit

mean(S < 0)    # probability of the casino losing money
```

We can plot a histogram of the observed values of S as well as the normal density curve based on the mean and standard deviation of S.

```{r}
s <- seq(min(S), max(S), length = 100)    # sequence of 100 values across range of S
normal_density <- data.frame(s = s, f = dnorm(s, mean(S), sd(S))) # generate normal density for S
data.frame (S = S) %>%    # make data frame of S for histogram
    ggplot(aes(S, ..density..)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "black", binwidth = 10) +
    ylab("Probability") +
    geom_line(data = normal_density, mapping = aes(s, f), color = "blue")
```

## Distributions versus Probability Distributions

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#distributions-versus-probability-distributions){target="_blank"}.

**Key points**

* A random variable $X$ has a probability distribution function $F(a)$ that defines $\mbox{Pr}(X \le a)$ over all values of $a$.
* Any list of numbers has a distribution. The probability distribution function of a random variable is defined mathematically and does not depend on a list of numbers.
* The results of a Monte Carlo simulation with a large enough number of observations will approximate the probability distribution of $X$.
* If a random variable is defined as draws from an urn:
    * The probability distribution function of the random variable is defined as the distribution of the list of values in the urn.
    * The expected value of the random variable is the average of values in the urn.
    * The standard error of one draw of the random variable is the standard deviation of the values of the urn.
    
## Notation for Random Variables

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#notation-for-random-variables){target="_blank"}.

**Key points**

* Capital letters denote random variables ($X$) and lowercase letters denote observed values ($x$).
* In the notation $\mbox{Pr}(X = x)$, we are asking how frequently the random variable $X$ is equal to the value $x$. For example, if $x = 6$, this statement becomes $\mbox{Pr}(X = 6)$.

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#the-expected-value-and-standard-error){target="_blank"} and [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#central-limit-theorem){target="_blank"}.

**Key points**

* The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says that the distribution of the sum of a random variable is approximated by a normal distribution.
* The expected value of a random variable, $E \left [ X \right] = \mu$, is the average of the values in the urn. This represents the expectation of one draw. 
* The standard error of one draw of a random variable is the standard deviation of the values in the urn.
* The expected value of the sum of draws is the number of draws times the expected value of the random variable. 
* The standard error of the sum of independent draws of a random variable is the square root of the number of draws times the standard deviation of the urn. 

*Equations*

These equations apply to the case where there are only two outcomes, $a$ and $b$ with proportions $p$ and $1-p$ respectively. The general principles above also apply to random variables with more than two outcomes.

Expected value of a random variable:

$ap + b(1-p)$

Expected value of the sum of n draws of a random variable: 

$n$ x $(ap + b(1-p))$

Standard deviation of an urn with two values: 

$|b-a|\sqrt{p(1-p)}$

Standard error of the sum of n draws of a random variable:

$\sqrt n$ x $|b-a|\sqrt{p(1-p)}$

## Assessment - Random Variables and Sampling Models

1. An American roulette wheel has 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green pockets. 

Each red and black pocket is associated with a number from 1 to 36. The two remaining green slots feature "0" and "00". Players place bets on which pocket they think a ball will land in after the wheel is spun. Players can bet on a specific number (0, 00, 1-36) or color (red, black, or green).

What are the chances that the ball lands in a green pocket?

```{r}
# The variables `green`, `black`, and `red` contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2/(2+18+18)

# Print the variable `p_green` to the console
p_green
```

2. In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. 

This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize.

Create a model to predict your winnings from betting on green one time.

```{r}
# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green = 1 - p_green


# Create a model to predict the random variable `X`, your winnings from betting on green. Sample one time.
X <- sample(c(-1,17), 1, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p_not_green, p_green))

# Print the value of `X` to the console
X
```

3. In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. 

This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize. In the previous exercise, you created a model to predict your winnings from betting on green.

Now, compute the expected value of $X$, the random variable you generated previously.

```{r}
# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Calculate the expected outcome if you win $17 if the ball lands on green and you lose $1 if the ball doesn't land on green
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              17 * p_green + (-1 * p_not_green)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ```
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4. The standard error of a random variable $X$ tells us the difference between a random variable and its expected value. You calculated a random variable $X$ in exercise 2 and the expected value of that random variable in exercise 3.

2a. Suppose that the number of multiple choice options is 4 and that there is no penalty for guessing - that is, an incorrect question gives a score of 0.

What is the expected value of the score when guessing on this new test?

  mu <- n * a*x + b*(1-x)
  sigma <- sqrt(n) * abs(b-a) * sqrt(x*(1-x))
  1-pnorm(35, mu, sigma)

min(p[which(exp_val > 0.8)])
```

## Assessment - Betting on Roulette

3. A casino offers a House Special bet on roulette, which is a bet on five pockets (00, 0, 1, 2, 3) out of 38 total pockets. The bet pays out 6 to 1. In other words, a losing bet yields -$1 and a successful bet yields $6. A gambler wants to know the chance of losing money if he places 500 bets on the roulette House Special.

# Section 4 Overview

Section 4 introduces you to the Big Short.

After completing Section 4, you will:

* understand the relationship between sampling models and interest rates as determined by banks.
* understand how interest rates can be set to minimize the chances of the bank losing money.
* understand how inappropriate assumptions of independence contributed to the financial meltdown of 2007.

## Interest Rates Explained

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#case-study-the-big-short){target="_blank"}.

**Key points**

* Interest rates for loans are set using the probability of loan defaults to calculate a rate that minimizes the probability of losing money.
* We can define the outcome of loans as a random variable. We can also define the sum of outcomes of many loans as a random variable.
* The Central Limit Theorem can be applied to fit a normal distribution to the sum of profits over many loans. We can use properties of the normal distribution to calculate the interest rate needed to ensure a certain probability of losing money for a given probability of default.

*Code: Interest rate sampling model*

```{r}
n <- 1000
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000
p <- 0.02
defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE)
sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
```

*Code: Interest rate Monte Carlo simulation*

```{r}
B <- 10000
losses <- replicate(B, {
    defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
  sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
})
```

*Code: Plotting expected losses*

```{r}
data.frame(losses_in_millions = losses/10^6) %>%
  ggplot(aes(losses_in_millions)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.6, col = "black")
```

*Code: Expected value and standard error of the sum of 1,000 loans*

```{r}
n*(p*loss_per_foreclosure + (1-p)*0)    # expected value 
sqrt(n)*abs(loss_per_foreclosure)*sqrt(p*(1-p))    # standard error
```

*Code: Calculating interest rates for expected value of 0*

We can calculate the amount $x$ to add to each loan so that the expected value is 0 using the equation $lp + x(1-p) = 0$. Note that this equation is the definition of expected value given a loss per foreclosure $l$ with foreclosure probability $p$ and profit $x$ if there is no foreclosure (probability $1-p$).

We solve for $x = - \frac {lp}{1-p}$ and calculate $x$:

```{r}
x = - loss_per_foreclosure*p/(1-p)
x
```

On a $180,000 loan, this equals an interest rate of:

```{r}
x/180000
```

*Equations: Calculating interest rate for 1% probability of losing money*

We want to calculate the value of $x$ for which $\mbox{Pr}(S < 0) = 0.01$. The expected value $E \left[ S \right]$ of the sum of $n = 1000$ loans given our definitions of $x$, $l$ and $p$ is:

$\mu_S = (lp + x(1-p))*n$

And the standard error of the sum of $n$ loans, $SE \left [ S \right]$, is:

$\sigma_S = |x-l|\sqrt{np(1-p)}$

Because we know the definition of a Z-score is $Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$, we know that $\mbox{Pr}(S < 0) = \mbox{Pr}(Z < - \frac{\mu}{\sigma})$. Thus, $\mbox{Pr}(S < 0) = 0.01$ equals:

$\mbox{Pr}(Z < \frac{-[lp + x(1-p)]n}{(x-l)\sqrt{np(1-p)}}) = 0.01$

We know that ```z<-qnorm(0.01)``` gives us the value of $z$ for which $\mbox{Pr}(Z \le z) = 0.01$, meaning:

$z = \frac{-[lp + x(1-p)]n}{(x-l)\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$

Solving for $x$ gives:

$x = -l \frac {np - z \sqrt{np(1-p)}}{n(1-p) + z \sqrt{np(1-p)}}$

*Code: Calculating interest rate for 1% probability of losing money*

```{r}
l <- loss_per_foreclosure
z <- qnorm(0.01)
x <- -l*( n*p - z*sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))/ ( n*(1-p) + z*sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))
x    # required profit when loan is not a foreclosure
x/180000    # interest rate
loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)    # expected value of the profit per loan
n*(loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)) # expected value of the profit over n loans
```

*Code: Monte Carlo simulation for 1% probability of losing money*

Note that your results will vary from the video because the seed is not set.

```{r}
B <- 100000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)    # expected value of the profit over n loans
mean(profit<0)    # probability of losing money
```

## The Big Short

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#the-big-short){target="_blank"}.

**Key points**

* The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of independent draws of a random variable follows a normal distribution. However, when the draws are not independent, this assumption does not hold.
* If an event changes the probability of default for all borrowers, then the probability of the bank losing money changes.
* Monte Carlo simulations can be used to model the effects of unknown changes in the probability of default.

*Code: Expected value with higher default rate and interest rate*

```{r}
p <- .04
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000
r <- 0.05
x <- r*180000
loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)
```

*Equations: Probability of losing money*

We can define our desired probability of losing money, $z$, as:

$\mbox{Pr}(S < 0) = \mbox{Pr}(Z < - \frac{E \left [S \right]}{SE \left [S \right]}) = \mbox{Pr}(Z < z)$

If $\mu$ is the expected value of the urn (one loan) and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the urn (one loan), then $E \left [S \right] = n \mu$ and $SE \left [S \right] = \sqrt{n \sigma}$.

We define the probability of losing money $z = 0.01$. In the first equation, we can see that:

$z = - \frac{E \left [S \right]}{SE \left [S \right]}$

It follows that:

$z = - \frac {n \mu}{\sqrt{n \sigma}} = - \frac {\sqrt{n \mu}}{\sigma}$

To find the value of $n$ for which $z$ is less than or equal to our desired value, we take $z \le - \frac {\sqrt{n \mu}}{\sigma}$ and solve for $n$:

$n \ge \frac {z^2 \sigma^2}{\mu^2}$

*Code: Calculating number of loans for desired probability of losing money*

The number of loans required is:

```{r}
z <- qnorm(0.01)
l <- loss_per_foreclosure
n <- ceiling((z^2*(x-l)^2*p*(1-p))/(l*p + x*(1-p))^2)
n    # number of loans required
n*(loss_per_foreclosure*p + x * (1-p))    # expected profit over n loans
```

Code: Monte Carlo simulation with known default probability

This Monte Carlo simulation estimates the expected profit given a known probability of default $p = 0.04$. Note that your results will differ from the video because the seed is not set.

```{r}
B <- 10000
p <- 0.04
x <- 0.05 * 180000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)
```

*Code: Monte Carlo simulation with unknown default probability*

This Monte Carlo simulation estimates the expected profit given an unknown probability of default $0.03 \le p \le 0.05$, modeling the situation where an event changes the probability of default for all borrowers simultaneously. Note that your results will differ from the video because the seed is not set.

```{r}
p <- 0.04
x <- 0.05*180000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    new_p <- 0.04 + sample(seq(-0.01, 0.01, length = 100), 1)
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-new_p, new_p), replace = TRUE) 
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)    # expected profit
mean(profit < 0)    # probability of losing money
mean(profit < -10000000)    # probability of losing over $10 million
```

## Assessment - The Big Short

1. Say you manage a bank that gives out 10,000 loans. 

The default rate is 0.03 and you lose $200,000 in each foreclosure.

Create a random variable $S$ that contains the earnings of your bank. Calculate the total amount of money lost in this scenario.

```{r}
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Generate a vector called `defaults` that contains the default outcomes of `n` loans
defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p_default, p_default), replace = TRUE)

# Generate `S`, the total amount of money lost across all foreclosures. Print the value to the console.
S <- sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
S
```

2. Run a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 outcomes for $S$, the sum of losses over 10,000 loans. Make a histogram of the results.

```{r}
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run
B <- 10000

# Generate a list of summed losses 'S'. Replicate the code from the previous exercise over 'B' iterations to generate a list of summed losses for 'n' loans.  Ignore any warnings for now.
S <- replicate(B, {
    defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p_default, p_default), replace = TRUE) 
  sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
})

# Plot a histogram of 'S'.  Ignore any warnings for now.
hist(S)
```

3. What is the expected value of $S$, the sum of losses over 10,000 loans? For now, assume a bank makes no money if the loan is paid.

```{r}
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Calculate the expected loss due to default out of 10,000 loans
n*(p_default*loss_per_foreclosure + (1-p_default)*0)
```

4. What is the standard error of $S$?

```{r}
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Compute the standard error of the sum of 10,000 loans
sqrt(n)*abs(loss_per_foreclosure)*sqrt(p_default*(1-p_default))
```

5. So far, we've been assuming that we make no money when people pay their loans and we lose a lot of money when people default on their loans. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Assume we give out loans for $180,000.

Make sure your package is up to date with the command ```update.packages("dslabs")```. You can also update all packages on your system by running ```update.packages()``` with no arguments, and you should consider doing this routinely.

The premium (annual cost) for this policy for a 50 year old female is $1,150. Suppose that in the event of a claim, the company forfeits the premium and loses a total of $150,000, and if there is no claim the company gains the premium amount of $1,150. The company plans to sell 1,000 policies to this demographic.

What is the expected value of the company's profit over all 1,000 policies for 50 year old females?

n*mu
```

1e. What is the standard error of the sum of the expected value over all 1,000 policies for 50 year old females?

```{r}
sqrt(n) * sigma
```

1f. Use the Central Limit Theorem to calculate the probability that the insurance company loses money on this set of 1,000 policies.

```{r}
pnorm(0, n*mu, sqrt(n)*sigma)
```

50 year old males have a different probability of death than 50 year old females. We will calculate a profitable premium for 50 year old males in the following four-part question.

2a. Use ```death_prob``` to determine the probability of death within one year for a 50 year old male.

```{r}
p_male <- death_prob %>%
  filter(sex == "Male" & age == "50") %>%
  pull(prob)
p_male
```

2b. Suppose the company wants its expected profits from 1,000 50 year old males with $150,000 life insurance policies to be $700,000. 

Use the formula for expected value of the sum of draws with the following values and solve for the premium $b$:

$E \left [𝑆 \right ] = \mu S = 700000$

$n=1000$

$p = \mbox{death probability of age 50 male}$

$a = 150000$

$b = \mbox{premium}$

$\mu_S = n(ap + b(1-p))$

$b = \frac{\frac{\mu_S}{n}-ap}{1-p}$

What premium should be charged?

```{r}
p <- p_male
mu_sum <- 700000
n <- 1000
a <- -150000

b <- (mu_sum/n-a*p)/(1-p)
b
```

2c. Using the new 50 year old male premium rate, calculate the standard error of the sum of 1,000 premiums.

```{r}
sigma_sum <- sqrt(n)*abs(b-a)*sqrt(p*(1-p))
sigma_sum
```

2d. What is the probability of losing money on a series of 1,000 policies to 50 year old males?

Use the Central Limit Theorem.

```{r}
pnorm(0, mu_sum, sigma_sum)
```

#### 3. and 4. Insurance rates, part 2

Life insurance rates are calculated using mortality statistics from the recent past. They are priced such that companies are almost assured to profit as long as the probability of death remains similar. If an event occurs that changes the probability of death in a given age group, the company risks significant losses.

In this 6-part question, we'll look at a scenario in which a lethal pandemic disease increases the probability of death within 1 year for a 50 year old to .015. Unable to predict the outbreak, the company has sold 1,000 $150,000 life insurance policies for $1,150.

Define a sampling model for simulating the total profit over 1,000 loans with probability of claim ```p_loss = .015```, loss of -$150,000 on a claim, and profit of $1,150 when there is no claim. Set the seed to 25, then run the model once.

If you use R 3.6 or later, you will need to use the command ```set.seed(x, sample.kind = "Rounding")``` instead of ```set.seed(x)```. Your R version will be printed at the top of the Console window when you start RStudio.)
